# Gravity SDOH Coordination Platform Reference Implementation Server

Reference Implementation CP HAPI FHIR® based server for the Coordination
Platform (CP) system as defined in the [Gravity SDOHCC Implementation
Guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/sdoh-clinicalcare/CapabilityStatement-SDOHCC-CoordinationPlatform.html).

## Prerequisites

- Java JDK 17 +
- Maven 3.8 +

## Installation

Clone this repository, then cd into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gravity-SDOHCC/gravity-sdoh-cp-server.git

cd gravity-sdoh-cp-server
```

## Running locally

The easiest way to run this server entirely depends on your environment requirements. At least, the following 4 ways are supported:

### Using jetty
```bash
mvn jetty:run
```


If you need to run this server on a different port (using Maven), you can change the port in the run command as follows:

```bash
mvn -Djetty.port=8888 jetty:run
```

Server will then be accessible at http://localhost:8888/ and eg. http://localhost:8888/fhir/metadata. Remember to adjust you overlay configuration in the application.yaml to eg.

```yaml
    tester:
      -
          id: home
          name: Local Tester
          server_address: 'http://localhost:8888/fhir'
          refuse_to_fetch_third_party_urls: false
          fhir_version: R4
```

### Using Spring Boot with :run
```bash
mvn clean spring-boot:run -Pboot
```
Server will then be accessible at http://localhost:8080/ and eg. http://localhost:8080/fhir/metadata. Remember to adjust you overlay configuration in the application.yaml to eg.

```yaml
    tester:
      -
          id: home
          name: Local Tester
          server_address: 'http://localhost:8080/fhir'
          refuse_to_fetch_third_party_urls: false
          fhir_version: R4
```

### Using Spring Boot
```bash
mvn clean package spring-boot:repackage -Pboot && java -jar target/ROOT.war
```
Server will then be accessible at http://localhost:8080/ and eg. http://localhost:8080/fhir/metadata. Remember to adjust you overlay configuration in the application.yaml to eg.

```yaml
    tester:
      -
          id: home
          name: Local Tester
          server_address: 'http://localhost:8080/fhir'
          refuse_to_fetch_third_party_urls: false
          fhir_version: R4
```
### Using Spring Boot and Google distroless
```bash
mvn clean package com.google.cloud.tools:jib-maven-plugin:dockerBuild -Dimage=distroless-hapi && docker run -p 8080:8080 distroless-hapi
```
Server will then be accessible at http://localhost:8080/ and eg. http://localhost:8080/fhir/metadata. Remember to adjust you overlay configuration in the application.yaml to eg.

```yaml
    tester:
      -
          id: home
          name: Local Tester
          server_address: 'http://localhost:8080/fhir'
          refuse_to_fetch_third_party_urls: false
          fhir_version: R4
```

### Using the Dockerfile and multistage build
```bash
./build-docker-image.sh && docker run -p 8080:8080 hapi-fhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter:latest
```
Server will then be accessible at http://localhost:8080/ and eg. http://localhost:8080/fhir/metadata. Remember to adjust you overlay configuration in the application.yaml to eg.

```yaml
    tester:
      -
          id: home
          name: Local Tester
          server_address: 'http://localhost:8080/fhir'
          refuse_to_fetch_third_party_urls: false
          fhir_version: R4
```

## Deployment

This server is automatically deployed to heroku with any push to the `master` branch.

## Using this Server

This server currently supports unauthenticated access. You can obtain the
supported endpoints and search parameters for each endpoint by querying the
metadata `[base_url]/metadata` (e.g. <http://localhost:8080/fhir/metadata>).

See [the usage
documentation](https://github.com/Gravity-SDOHCC/sdoh_referral_source_client/blob/master/docs/usage.md)
for instructions on using the whole reference implementations.
